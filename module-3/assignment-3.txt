5. Not a Spectator Sport...

I have been working on the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree, and have found out first hand how complex approaching coding projects can be. I know that what looks like a two hour project can often turn into a three day journey of research, tutorials, and building! One barrier I can anticipate is not using my time efficiently or losing focus. I am expressly applying to a GW because the experience working with teams and with internal/external deadlines will benefit me. Furthermore, I often become obsessed with depth over breadth. So, I know that in a program that covers an immense amount of material in an abbreviated amount of time, I am going to have to remind myself that it’s ok if I don’t master the material or tools in a day, and make concrete plans to work on individual and open source projects that will help continue to cement the concepts and tools after graduation. I will be my own cheerleader and not let myself get discouraged; the biggest barrier I will probably face is simply keeping the faith that I can endure emotionally and intellectually through this incredibly demanding process. I need to keep in mind that making mistakes is a part of learning, not a sign of failure. I need to remember that the tech landscape is constantly shifting and techies are all always improvising to keep up. Working in tech is not becoming a master, it’s becoming an expert shapeshifter. I need to let go of feeling that I am an imposter when I don’t already know everything and embrace my own capacity to take initiative and work creatively. That’s the only way that I will really begin to build my own tools and solutions, rather than doing endless tutorials in trying to learn everything.
